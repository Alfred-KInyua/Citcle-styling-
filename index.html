        <p>Meet Faiza Wanjiru, a 35 year old lady from Mjini Village, Township Ward, Kiharu Sub County in Muranga
            County, with a very inspiring story on God’s faithfulness on her life’s journey towards recovery from drug
            addiction.</br>

            Faiza got pregnant at the age of 14 years and to her, this was an addition to the already existing troubles
            in her life. Her parents were separated when she was four years old hence she was living with her older
            brother who had educated her up to class 8. She then began looking for her mother who she hoped would
            educate her further. Instead, her mother chased her away to fend for herself and take care of her child. At
            this point she felt rejected and wondered how she would ever go through life. </br>

            Having lost hope, Faiza began to look for ways of survival which included agreeing to sell her son at Ksh
            20,000. She had already received a deposit of Ksh 10,000 when the information leaked to the police who
            arrested her and took her to Kirigiti Police station. At this time she had gotten into prostitution and
            using drugs including cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and bhang. Faiza even engaged in shoplifting activities in
            Nairobi supermarkets which landed her in Langata women prison..</p>
